##Teachers, Learners & Lessons

 A short programming exercise to practice using Classes

 A person has a firstName, lastName & email address.

#####Teachers & Learners
 A teacher teach 1-more subjects. They can only teach subjects they are qualified for.

 A Learner needs to be registered for 3 subjects before that can attend any lesson.

 Lessons & Subjects
 Lessons are for a given Subject. Learners can only attend Lessons for Subjects they are registered for.

 A Lesson is taught by a teacher - attended by learners. If there are less than 5 learners attending a Lesson is cancelled. A teacher earn 5 tokens for each lesson teached. A Lesson has a teacher, time and subject. A learner can only attend one lesson at a time.

#####Notes & Tokens

 Each time a learner attend a Lesson they are given notes. If a learner didn't attended a Lesson the can ask other learners who attended a Lesson for the notes.

 Attending a Lesson earn a learner 3 tokens. Asking for notes costs 2 tokens. You can only ask for notes if you have enough tokens.

 Asking for notes of Subjects you are not registered for costs 5 tokens.

 Learners should keep track of Notes they have and if they earned it via lesson attendance or bought it.

 At the end of each day a Learners should be able to see what notes and how much tokens they have.

#####Cafeteria

 Tokens can be used at the Cafeteria to Buy Breakfast (4 tokens), Lunch (6 tokens) or an afternoon snack (3 tokens). A drink costs 2 tokens. The Cafeteria manager wants a total of daily tokens received. And also which Person bought what. Teacher gets a 25% discount in the cafeteria once they taught 5 lessons.

 The Principal needs to know how many Lessons for each subject is taught on a day and how many Lessons have been cancelled for the day.

#####Instructions

Create all the Classes needed for this scenario. Wire them all together to model 1 school day.

* Use the the Java Collection Framework where needed.
* Focus on 1 school day only.
* Write JUnit tests. Use TDD! Write your tests first.
* No persistence is required.
